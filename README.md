# ** THIS PROJECT IS MOVED TO [Wikipedia Corpus Builder](https://github.com/IDS-Mannheim/Wikipedia-Corpus-Builder)



## Wikipedia Corpus Converter


This project was developed at Institut für Deutsche Sprache (IDS) in 
Mannheim, Germany. The aim of the project was to automatically generate 
Wikipedia corpora in I5 format (http://corpora.ids-mannheim.de/I5/DTD/i5.dtd),  
the XML format used in the German Reference Corpora (Deutsches Referenzkorpus - DeReKo) hosted by IDS.

This task is done in two stages: firstly wikitext is converted to XML, and 
secondly the XML-ized Wikipedia pages are converted to I5. For the first conversion stage, 
we use Sweble parser version 2.0.0-alpha-2-SNAPSHOT, and for the second conversion stage, Saxon-EE 9.4.0.3J. A Saxon-HE version is not applicable, because the XSLT Stylesheets 
converting XML to I5 make use of Saxon extension functions.


For questions and suggestions, please contact Eliza Margaretha 
(margaretha at ids-mannheim.de) or Harald Lüngen (luengen at ids-mannheim.de).
