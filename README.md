WikipediaCorpus
===============

This project was developed at Institut f√ºr Deutsche Sprache (IDS) in 
Mannheim, Germany. The aim of the project was to automatically generate 
a Wikipedia corpus in IDS-XCES format. This is done in two stages: 
firstly wikitext is converted to XML, and secondly the XML is converted 
to IDS-XCES. IDS-XCES is an XML format used in the German Reference Corpora 
(Deutsches Referenzkorpus - DeReKo) hosted by IDS.

For questions and suggestions, please contact Eliza Margaretha
